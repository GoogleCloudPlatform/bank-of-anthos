### Scripts

- `scripts/deploy-monolith.sh`: deploys service to a VM on Google Compute Engine
- `scripts/teardown-monolith.sh`: teardown service from Google Compute Engine
- `scripts/push-artifacts.sh`: pushes build artifacts to Google Cloud Storage
- `scripts/delete-artifacts.sh`: deletes build artifacts in Google Cloud Storage

## Deploying

### From Canonical Artifacts

Deploy the canonical version of the monolith to a Google Compute Engine VM.
Use canonical build artifacts hosted on Google Cloud Storage at
`gs://bank-of-anthos/monolith`.

#### Make

```
# In the root directory of the project repo
PROJECT_ID=<your-project-id>
ZONE=<your-gcp-zone>
make deploy-monolith
```

#### Bash

```
# In the root directory of the project repo
PROJECT_ID=<your-project-id>
ZONE=<your-gcp-zone>
./src/ledgermonolith/scripts/deploy-monolith.sh
```

### With Custom-built Artifacts

Deploy a custom version of the monolith to a Google Compute Engine VM.
Compile and build artifacts locally and push them to Google Cloud Storage (GCS).

Specify the GCS location with environment variable `GCS_BUCKET`.
Artifacts will be pushed to `gs://{GCS_BUCKET}/monolith'.

#### Make

```
# In the root directory of the project repo
PROJECT_ID=<your-project-id>
ZONE=<your-gcp-zone>
GCS_BUCKET=<your-gcs-bucket>
make monolith
make deploy-monolith
```

#### Bash

```
# In the root directory of the project repo
PROJECT_ID=<your-project-id>
ZONE=<your-gcp-zone>
GCS_BUCKET=<your-gcs-bucket>
./src/ledgermonolith/scripts/push-artifacts.sh
./src/ledgermonolith/scripts/deploy-monolith.sh
```
