### Scripts

- `scripts/deploy-monolith.sh`: deploys service to a VM on Google Compute Engine
- `scripts/teardown-monolith.sh`: teardown service from Google Compute Engine
- `scripts/build-artifacts.sh`: pushes build artifacts to Google Cloud Storage
- `scripts/delete-artifacts.sh`: deletes build artifacts in Google Cloud Storage

## Deploying the Monolith 

### Option 1 - From Canonical Artifacts

Deploy the canonical version of the monolith to a Google Compute Engine VM.
Use canonical build artifacts hosted on Google Cloud Storage at
`gs://bank-of-anthos/monolith`.

#### Make

```
# In the root directory of the project repo
PROJECT_ID=<your-project-id>
ZONE=<your-gcp-zone>
make monolith-deploy
```

#### Bash

```
# In the root directory of the project repo
PROJECT_ID=<your-project-id>
ZONE=<your-gcp-zone>
./src/ledgermonolith/scripts/deploy-monolith.sh
```

### Option 2 - With Custom-built Artifacts

Deploy a custom version of the monolith to a Google Compute Engine VM.
Compile and build artifacts locally and push them to Google Cloud Storage (GCS).

Specify the GCS location with environment variable `GCS_BUCKET`.
Artifacts will be pushed to `gs://{GCS_BUCKET}/monolith`.

#### Make

```
# In the root directory of the project repo
PROJECT_ID=<your-project-id>
ZONE=<your-gcp-zone>
GCS_BUCKET=<your-gcs-bucket>
make monolith-build
```

#### Bash

```
# In the root directory of the project repo
PROJECT_ID=<your-project-id>
ZONE=<your-gcp-zone>
GCS_BUCKET=<your-gcs-bucket>
./src/ledgermonolith/scripts/build-artifacts.sh
./src/ledgermonolith/scripts/deploy-monolith.sh
```

## Checking the Monolith

### Startup Script Logs

The output of the monolith VM startup procedure is logged.

1. Go to the [Google Compute Engine instances page](https://cloud.google.com/compute/instances).
2. Select `View logs` under the `...` options button for the monolith VM: `ledgermonolith-service`. 
3. Search for "startup-script" in the search bar of the Logs Viewer.

### App Build Artifacts

Build artifacts for the monolith VM should be saved to `/opt/monolith`.

1. Go to the [Google Compute Engine instances page](https://cloud.google.com/compute/instances).
2. Click the `SSH` button on the monolith VM: `ledgermonolith-service`.
3. Enter `ls /opt/monolith` in the shell prompt.

### Java App Logs

Runtime logs for the java app are piped to `/var/log/monolith.log`.

1. Go to the [Google Compute Engine instances page](https://cloud.google.com/compute/instances).
2. Click the `SSH` button on the monolith VM: `ledgermonolith-service`.
3. Enter `tail -f /var/log/monolith.log` in the shell prompt.

### Serving HTTP Requests

The monolith service can be queried via HTTP from a client on the same Google
Cloud network that also has the `monolith` network tag.

1. Go to the [Google Compute Engine instances page](https://cloud.google.com/compute/instances).
2. Note the internal ip address of the monolith VM: `ledgermonolith-service`.
3. Create a VM instance on the monolith network - `default` - and add the network tag `monolith`.
4. Click the `SSH` button on the instance after it has successfully started.
5. Enter `curl ledgermonolith-service.c.[PROJECT_ID].internal:8080/version` in the shell prompt, replacing PROJECT_ID with your GCP project id.
6. If you see a version string like `v0.1.0`, the ledgermonolith is correctly serving HTTP requests


## Deploying the Rest of the Services

Kubernetes manifests and a `skaffold.yaml` file are provided in the `kubernetes-manifests/` directory - containing the Python services (including the frontend), plus the accounts database. To deploy:

1. Populate the ConfigMap with your ledger monolith info (`config.yaml.template`). This tells the frontend how to reach the Java/ledger endpoints.


2. Run the following command from this directory: 

```
skaffold run --default-repo=gcr.io/${PROJECT_ID}/with-monolith
```
