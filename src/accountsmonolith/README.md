# Accounts Monolith Service

The user service endpoints manages user accounts and authentication.
It creates and signs JWTs that are used by other services to authenticate users.
The contacts service endpoints  stores a list of saved accounts associated with a user.
Data from the contacts service endpoints is used for drop down in "Send Payment" and "Deposit" forms.

Implemented in Python with Flask.
