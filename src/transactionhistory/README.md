# Transaction History Service

The transaction history service provides an efficient readable cache of past transactions, as read from ledger.

The `ledger-db` service holds the source of truth for the system. The `transaction-history` returns data on a
best-effort basis, but may be out of date when under heavy load.

Implemented in Java with Spring Boot.
