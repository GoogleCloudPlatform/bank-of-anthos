# Balance Reader Service

The balance reader service provides an efficient readable cache of user balances, as read from the `ledger-db`.

The `ledger-db` service holds the source of truth for the system. The `balance-reader` returns data on a
best-effort basis, but may be out of date when under heavy load.

Implemented in Java with Spring Boot.
