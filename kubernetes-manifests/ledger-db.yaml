# Ledger Database Configuration for Google Cloud Spanner
#
# The ledger database now uses Google Cloud Spanner, a fully managed,
# globally distributed, and horizontally scalable relational database service.
# No StatefulSet or Service is required as Spanner is a managed service.
#
# Prerequisites:
# 1. Create a Spanner instance and database using the init-spanner.sh script
# 2. Update the configuration below with your GCP project, instance, and database IDs
# 3. Ensure your GKE cluster has Workload Identity or appropriate service account
#    credentials to access Spanner
