# Bank of Anthos Minikube Quickstart

## 
This tutorial shows you how to deploy the Bank of Anthos app to a Kubernetes cluster.

You'll be able to run Bank of Anthos on:
- a local **[minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/)** cluster, which comes built in to the Cloud Shell instance
- a **[Google Kubernetes Engine](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine)** cluster using a new or existing [Google Cloud Platform project](https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/creating-managing-projects#creating_a_project)

Let's get started!

## Kubernetes cluster setup

Set up a Kubernetes cluster using the instructions below for either **minikube** or **GKE**.

---
### Minikube

Minikube creates a local Kubernetes cluster on Cloud Shell.

1. Click <walkthrough-editor-spotlight spotlightId="minikube-status-bar">minikube</walkthrough-editor-spotlight> on the status bar located at the bottom of the editor window.

2. The command palette will prompt you to choose which minikube cluster to control. Select **minikube** and, in the next prompt, click **Start**. 

3. If prompted, authorize Cloud Shell to make a GCP API call with your credentials.

Once minikube has finished starting, you're ready to move on to the next step.


--- 

### GKE

In order to create a GKE cluster, you'll need to **[create a Google Cloud Platform project](https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/creating-managing-projects#creating_a_project)** or use an existing project.

1. Access the command palette by going to **View > Find Command**.

2. Run the command **"Cloud Code: Create GKE cluster"**.

3. Select your GCP project. 

4. Apply the following configurations in the GKE wizard:  
> - Zone: us-central1-b
> - Cluster name: bank-of-anthos
> - Node count: 4
> - Machine type: e2-standard-2

5. Click **Create Cluster**. Once your cluster has been created successfully, you can move on to the next step.


## Deploy JWT token

Bank of Anthos uses a JWT token for user account creation and authentication. 

To deploy the token:

1. Open <walkthrough-editor-open-file filePath="extras/jwt/jwt-secret.yaml">jwt-secret.yaml
</walkthrough-editor-open-file>. 

2. Access the command palette by going to **View > Find Command**.

3. Run the command **"Cloud Code: Apply the current JSON/YAML file to the kubernetes deployed resource"**.   

4. The following warning will pop up:  

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Resource Secret/jwt-key does not exist - this will create a new resource.

5. Click **Create**.   

This deploys the demo JWT public key to your cluster as a Secret.

For more information about using JWT keys in Bank of Anthos, check out the <walkthrough-editor-open-file filePath="extras/jwt/README.md">JWT Key Pair Secret README</walkthrough-editor-open-file>.

## Run on Kubernetes

Now you can run Bank of Anthos on your Kubernetes cluster!

1. Launch the <walkthrough-editor-spotlight spotlightId="cloud-code-status-bar">Cloud Code menu</walkthrough-editor-spotlight> from the status bar and select <walkthrough-editor-spotlight spotlightId="cloud-code-run-on-k8s">Run on Kubernetes</walkthrough-editor-spotlight>.

2. If prompted to select a Skaffold Profile, select **[default]**.

3. Select **Yes** to confirm your current context.

4. If you're using a GKE cluster, you'll need to confirm your container image registry.

Cloud Code uses configurations defined in <walkthrough-editor-open-file filePath="skaffold.yaml">skaffold.yaml</walkthrough-editor-open-file> to build and deploy the app. *It may take a minute for the deploy to complete.*

5. Once the app is running, the local URLs will be displayed in the <walkthrough-editor-spotlight spotlightId="output">Output</walkthrough-editor-spotlight> terminal. 

7. To access your Bank of Anthos frontend service, click on the <walkthrough-spotlight-pointer spotlightId="devshell-web-preview-button" target="cloudshell">Web Preview button</walkthrough-spotlight-pointer> in the upper right of the editor window.

8. Select **Change Port** and enter '4503' as the port, then click **Change and Preview**. Your app will open in a new window. 
 

## Stop the app

To stop running the app: 

1. Go to the <walkthrough-editor-spotlight spotlightId="activity-bar-debug">Debug view</walkthrough-editor-spotlight> 

2. Click the 'Stop' icon. üü•

3. Select **Yes** to clean up deployed resources. 

You can start, stop, and debug apps from the Debug view.

If you've deployed your app to a GKE cluster in your Google Cloud Platform project, you'll want to delete the cluster to avoid incurring charges.

1. Navigate to the <walkthrough-editor-spotlight spotlightId="activity-bar-cloud-k8s">Cloud Code - Kubernetes view</walkthrough-editor-spotlight> in the Activity bar.

2. Under the <walkthrough-editor-spotlight spotlightId="cloud-code-gke-explorer">Google Kubernetes Engine Explorer tab</walkthrough-editor-spotlight>, right-click on your cluster and select **Delete Cluster**.
