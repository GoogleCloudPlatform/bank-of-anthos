# Bank of Anthos

**Bank of Anthos** is a sample HTTP-based web app that simulates a bank's payment processing network, allowing users to create artificial bank accounts and complete transactions. 

Google uses this application to demonstrate how developers can modernize enterprise applications using GCP products, including: [GKE](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine), [Anthos Service Mesh](https://cloud.google.com/anthos/service-mesh), [Anthos Config Management](https://cloud.google.com/anthos/config-management), [Migrate for Anthos](https://cloud.google.com/migrate/anthos), [Spring Cloud GCP](https://spring.io/projects/spring-cloud-gcp), and [Cloud Operations](https://cloud.google.com/products/operations). This application works on any Kubernetes cluster.

| [contacts](./src/contacts)                       | Python        | Stores list of other accounts associated with a user. Used for drop down in "Send Payment" and "Deposit" forms. |
| [accounts-db](./src/accounts-db)                 | PostgreSQL | Database for user accounts and associated data. Option to pre-populate with demo users.                                                      |
| [loadgenerator](./src/loadgenerator)             | Python/Locust | Continuously sends requests imitating users to the frontend. Periodically creates new accounts and simulates transactions between them.      |

## Quickstart (GKE)

1. **[Create a Google Cloud Platform project](https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/creating-managing-projects#creating_a_project)** or use an existing project. Set the `PROJECT_ID` environment variable and ensure the Google Kubernetes Engine API is enabled.

```
PROJECT_ID=""
gcloud services enable container --project ${PROJECT_ID}
```

2. **Clone this repository.**

```
git clone https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/bank-of-anthos.git
cd bank-of-anthos
```

3. **Create a GKE cluster.** 

```
ZONE=us-central1-b
gcloud beta container clusters create bank-of-anthos \
    --project=${PROJECT_ID} --zone=${ZONE} \
    --machine-type=e2-standard-2 --num-nodes=4
```

4. **Deploy the demo JWT public key** to the cluster as a Secret. This key is used for user account creation and authentication. 

```
kubectl apply -f ./extras/jwt/jwt-secret.yaml
```

5. **Deploy the sample app to the cluster.** 

```
kubectl apply -f ./kubernetes-manifests
```

6. **Wait for the Pods to be ready.** 

```
kubectl get pods
```

After a few minutes, you should see:

```
NAME                                  READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
accounts-db-6f589464bc-6r7b7          1/1     Running   0          99s
balancereader-797bf6d7c5-8xvp6        1/1     Running   0          99s

ledgerwriter-84bf44b95d-65mqf         1/1     Running   0          97s
loadgenerator-559667b6ff-4zsvb        1/1     Running   0          97s
transactionhistory-5569754896-z94cn   1/1     Running   0          97s
userservice-78dc876bff-pdhtl          1/1     Running   0          96s
```

7. **Access the web frontend in a browser** using the frontend's `EXTERNAL_IP`. 

```
kubectl get service frontend | awk '{print $4}'
```

*Example output - do not copy*

```
EXTERNAL-IP
35.223.69.29
```

## Other Deployment Options 

- **Workload Identity**: [See these instructions.](docs/workload-identity.md)
- **Istio**: Apply `istio-manifests/` to your cluster to access the frontend through the IngressGateway. 
- **Anthos Service Mesh**: ASM requires Workload Identity to be enabled in your GKE cluster. [See the workload identity instructions](docs/workload-identity.md) to configure and deploy the app. Then, apply `istio-manifests/` to your cluster to confugure frontend ingress. 
- **Java Monolith (VM)**: We provide a version of this app where the three Java microservices are coupled together into one monolithic service, which you can deploy inside a VM (eg. Google Compute Engine). See the [ledgermonolith](src/ledgermonolith) directory.

## Troubleshooting 

See the [Troubleshooting guide](docs/troubleshooting.md) for resolving common problems. 

## Development 

See the [Development guide](docs/development.md) to learn how to run and develop this app locally.
