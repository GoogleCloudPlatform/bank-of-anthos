## Directive to show how learning could work

Directive (Tribal Knowledge): In upcoming interactions involving latency or performance analysis for ‘userservice,’ Use trace data and the span tag public_key_bit_size values from the 'userservice'. Assume value 512 is standard. higher is slower & lower is faster both are undesired

## Question to ask  to show analysis

Can you explain the latency differences in the 'userservice' between 'us-bank-b' and 'us-bank-a'. Use trace data and the span tag public_key_bit_size values from the 'userservice'. Assume value 512 is standard. higher is slower & lower is faster both are undesired
